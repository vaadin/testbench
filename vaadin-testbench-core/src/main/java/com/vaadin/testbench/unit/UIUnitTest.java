/**
 * Base JUnit 5 class for UI unit tests.
 * 
 * Subclasses should typically restrict classpath scanning to a specific package
 * for faster bootstrap by overriding {@link #scanPackage()} method.
 *
 * Set up of Vaadin environment is performed before each test by
 * {@link #initVaadinEnvironment()} method, and will be executed before
 * {@code @BeforeEach} methods defined in subclasses. At the same way, cleanup
 * tasks operated by {@link #cleanVaadinEnvironment()} are executed after each
 * test, and after all {@code @AfterEach} annotated methods in subclasses.
 *
 * Usually, it is not necessary to override {@link #initVaadinEnvironment()} or
 * {@link #cleanVaadinEnvironment()} methods, but if this is done it is
 * mandatory to add the {@code @BeforeEach} and {@code @AfterEach} annotations
 * in the subclass, in order to have hooks handled by testing framework.
