 * ### Mocking server request end
 *
 * Since UI Unit Testing runs in the same JVM as the server and there is no browser, the boundaries between the client and
 * the server become unclear. When looking into sources of any test method, it's really hard to tell where exactly the server request ends, and
 * where another request starts.
 *
 * You can establish an explicit client boundary in your test, by explicitly calling [MockVaadin.clientRoundtrip]. However, since that
 * would be both laborous and error-prone, the default operation is that UI Unit Testing pretends as if there was a client-server
 * roundtrip before every component lookup
 * via the [_get]/[_find]/[_expectNone]/[_expectOne] call. Therefore, [MockVaadin.clientRoundtrip] is called from [awaitBeforeLookup] by default.
