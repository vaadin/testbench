= Overview

Vaadin TestBench is a tool for controlling the browser from Java and automatically execute repetitive tasks such as functional, compatibility or integration tests. TestBench is also able to visually inspect your application and detect unintentionally introduced changes or verify that the application visually looks ok in all the browsers you are targeting. TestBench also includes special support for other Vaadin products, making testing easy and robust compared to generic web testing solutions. Although not the main purpose of TestBench, you can also use TestBench to automate mundane tasks such as filling out forms.

== A Typical Test

A typical test can look like:
1. Start a browser instances (Chrome/Firefox/Safari/IE11/Edge are supported desktop browsers, iPhone/iPad/Android simulators are also supported).
2. Fill in the login form and log in to the application
3. Navigate to the order view
4. Fill in form fields to place an order
5. Verify that the order was placed

In Java code, this could be:

```java
@Test
public void fillForm() {
   setDriver(new ChromeDriver());
   getDriver().get("http://localhost:8080");
   LoginViewElement loginView = $(LoginViewElement.class).first();
   MainViewElement mainView = loginView.login("admin@vaadin.com", "admin");
   FormViewElement formView = mainView.navigateTo("form");
   formView.clickNew();
   formView.setName("John", "Doe");
   formView.clickSave();
   Assert.assertEquals("John Doe was added", formView.getMessage());
}
```

The code above uses the [Page Object](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/PageObject.html) pattern (or View Object in this case) to hide the implementation details of the view from the main test logic. For a more in-depth example, see https://github.com/vaadin/testbench-demo.

TestBench also supports much more complex test cases such as running on multiple browser instances in parallel, testing that an application works when multiple users interact simultaneously with the same view/data and comparing that the main view of the application still looks like the pregenerated reference screenshot.

== Features

The main features of Vaadin TestBench are:

* Control one or several browser instances from Java, both desktop and mobile browsers
* A powerful and robust way to describe your tests so they do not break with every application change
* A high level API for finding the component you want to interact with
* Vaadin Component API for easy interaction with all Vaadin components and HTML elements
* Automatic screen comparison with difference highlighting
* Assertion based UI state validation
* Support for easily running tests in parallel
* Test grid support for speeding up tests by running in parallel on multiple browsers on selected operating systems
* Support for JUnit and other testing frameworks
* Based on Selenium for low level support

== Licensing and Trial Period

Vaadin TestBench is a commercial product and part of the [Pro Subscription](https://vaadin.com/pricing). You will be asked to validate your license or start a trial period when you start using the tool.
