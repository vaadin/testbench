= TestBench 4 to TestBench 5 Migration Guide

[[testbench.migration.introduction]]
== Introduction

Vaadin TestBench 5 is intended to test Vaadin Framework 8 applications.

Vaadin TestBench 5 is API compatible with Vaadin TestBench 4.x, and can thus be used as a drop-in replacement for any 4.x version provided the tested project has been migrated to Vaadin Framework 8, see Vaadin Framework 8 migration guide.
The exceptions to this rule are listed in the API changes section below.

== API Changes in TestBench 5

* [classname]#CheckBoxGroupElement# added to test [classname]#CheckBoxGroup# Component
* [classname]#RadioButtonGroupElement# added to test [classname]#RadioButtonGroup# Component

[[testbench.migration.deprecated-elements]]
== Testing Deprecated Vaadin Components

Vaadin Framework 8 provides an optional dependency that includes compatibility components to facilitate the migration between versions 7 and 8.

=== Compatibility Only Components

Some components only exist in [package]#com.vaadin.v7.ui# compatibility package like:

* [classname]#Table#
* [classname]#Tree#
* [classname]#TreeTable#
* [classname]#Form#
* [classname]#PopupDateField#
* [classname]#Calendar#
* [classname]#OptionGroup#
* [classname]#ProgressIndicator#
* [classname]#Select#

Such components and their corresponding [classname]#TestBenchElement# have been deprecated but can still be used and tested.

=== Compatibility and Vaadin 8 Components

Other components exist in both [package]#com.vaadin.v7.ui# and [package]#com.vaadin.ui# packages. In these cases the same [classname]#TestBenchElement# can be used to test either version.

One example of this is [classname]#NativeSelectElement# that can be used to test both [package]#com.vaadin.v7.ui#  [classname]#NativeSelect# and [package]#com.vaadin.ui#  [classname]#NativeSelect#

== Changes in dependency

Selenium::
Selenium version was upgraded to 3.0.1. TestBench 5 should still work with older (Selenium 2 / TestBench 4 based) test clusters.
